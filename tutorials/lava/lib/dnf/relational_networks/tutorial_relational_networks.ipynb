    "# Relational networks\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to set up a relational network with lava-dnf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational networks are a network topology composed of DNFs that enables representing relational features, for example the difference/error between two represented values. In DFT, relational networks are one of the major building blocks of larger architectures, most often employed to implement coordinate transforms between different spaces (e.g., retinal vs. allocentric visual space).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diagram relational network](./diagram_relational_network.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure above illustrates the network topology. Two 1D DNFs, ‘target’ and ‘reference’, are input into a 2D-dimensional ‘transformation’ DNF that represents all possible combinations of the positions in the two DNFs. The 1D DNFs project into the ‘transformation’ DNF, forming subthreshold ridges of activation; only regions in which the ridges overlap form peaks. This activation projects along the diagonal onto the ‘relational’ DNF. The peaks that form there represent the peak-positions in the ‘target’ DNF relative to the position of the peak-position in the ‘reference’ DNF (center of the ‘relational’ DNF).\n",
    "The diagram visualizes an example with one-dimensional input and output DNFs but the same concept can be applied to higher-dimensional input/output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In lava-dnf, relational networks can be constructed from basic Lava Processes, like the LIF Processes, and connectivity structures that can be generated with the `connect` function from lava-dnf. The following example demonstrates a relational network with one-dimensional input."

Relational networks can also be set up with bidirectional connectivity, coupling all four DNFs in both directions. This enables reading out the target (or reference) position given both the relative position and the reference (or target) position.\n",
